    """
    Interface for Pandas GroupBy operations allowing specified group order.

    Writing our own class to do this has a few advantages:
    - It constrains the interface between Plot and Stat/Move objects
    - It allows control over the row order of the GroupBy result, which is
      important when using in the context of some Move operations (dodge, stack, ...)
    - It simplifies some complexities regarding the return type and Index contents
      one encounters with Pandas, especially for DataFrame -> DataFrame applies
    - It increases future flexibility regarding alternate DataFrame libraries

        Initialize the GroupBy from grouping variables and optional level orders.

        Parameters
        ----------
        order
            List of variable names or dict mapping names to desired level orders.
            Level order values can be None to use default ordering rules. The
            variables can include names that are not expected to appear in the
            data; these will be dropped before the groups are defined.
